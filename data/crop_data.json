    "season": "Year-round in tropical climates; best during monsoon (June-August) for adequate moisture.",
    "soil": "Well-drained sandy loam or coastal alluvial soils; pH 5.0-8.0.",
    "watering": "Regular irrigation during dry spells; avoid waterlogging. Mature trees need 100-120 L/week.",
    "fertilizer": "NPK 12:12:17:2 MgO + micronutrients; apply 1 kg/year of age up to 10 years. Organic compost recommended.",

    "season": "Kharif (June-November) for monsoon-dependent; Rabi (November-March) with irrigation.",
    "soil": "Clayey loam with good water retention; pH 5.0-6.5. Flood-prone or waterlogged areas suitable.",
    "watering": "Continuous flooding (5-10 cm water depth) during growth; drain before harvest.",
    "fertilizer": "NPK 100:50:50 kg/ha + zinc sulfate. Split application: basal, tillering, panicle initiation.",

  "rubber": {
    "season": "Plant at onset of monsoon (May-July) for seedling establishment.",
    "soil": "Deep, well-drained acidic loams (pH 4.5-6.5); avoid waterlogged or saline soils.",
    "watering": "Regular irrigation until maturity (3-4 years); drought-tolerant thereafter.",
    "fertilizer": "NPK 10:10:10 + magnesium; apply 500 g/tree/year initially, increasing to 2 kg for mature trees.",
    "pests": "Abnormal leaf fall, powdery mildew, bird's eye spot. Pests: Termites, mealybugs.",
